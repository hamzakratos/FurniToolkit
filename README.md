FurniToolkit
============

This tool has two features:
1. Convert old furnidata.txt to the new furnidata.xml format
2. Sync two furnidata XML files:
 - The functions make a new furnidata.xml from the source file, and adds the missing entries which the sync-file has.
 
 You can enter both an URL and a local file path in the boxes.
